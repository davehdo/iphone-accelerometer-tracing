## Inspiration
The gait is probably the most diagnostically sensitive part of the neurological examination, but is poorly quantified. We built a browser-based app that used the smart phoneâ€™s accelerometer to better quantify gait.

## What it does
Uses the built in accelerometer to trace the gait for the doctor for better quantification and storage for interval comparison

## How I built it
Built a web app that uses the smart phone's accelerometer

## Challenges I ran into
Integrating the accelerometer to obtain position is noisy

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Installation-free use of native hardware

## What I learned
Anything is possible

## What's next for ataxic
